# airline-web-page
This web is based from my project in my fourth year of university when the student are given a task to create airline start-up.
Therefore, making a mock-up landing page is included in the project final score.

Lately I'm learning about front-end development and I'm thinking about creating a responsive landing page for my project.

Thanks to the julio codes youtube channel for providing code tutorials. On this website I still use julio codes' designs and
codes because I want to practice and increase my knowledge.
